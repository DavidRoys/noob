## Features

|Feature  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Initialise**     | Noob only has one feature - to copy files from the configured file path to the current workspace. To configure noob, open settings and fill in the path to a folder that contains your starter project. If you want to do anything fancy - like select from a list of project types, or substitute placeholders within certain files, see the [.noob\settings.json](#noobsettingsjson) section. |

## Known Issues

- See github issues

## Thanks to

- David Feldhoff for your time, expertise, and generosity. I would not have started this project without your help.

## .noob\settings.json

If the folder you are copying files from contains a .noob folder and if that folder contains a settings.json, you'll be able to access some more advanced features of noob such as presenting the user with a menu of project types to select and specifying files in the folder that should have variables substituted.
